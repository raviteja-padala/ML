# Linear_Regression_Assumptions

Linear regression is the simplest machine learning algorithm of predictive analysis. Linear regression algorithm shows a linear relationship between a dependent (y variable) and one or more independent (x variable) variables hence it is known as linear regression. Since linear regression shows the linear relationship, which means it finds how the value of the dependent variable is changing according to the value of the independent variable. Linear regression makes predictions for continuous/real or numeric variables such as sales, salary, age, product price, etc.

The theory of linear regression is based on certain statistical assumptions. It is crucial to check these regression assumptions before modeling the data using the linear regression approach.

Assumptions of Linear Regression:

1.Linear relationship between input and output.

2.No Multicollinearity

3.Normality of Residual

4.Homoscedasticity

5.No Autocorrelation of Errors.
